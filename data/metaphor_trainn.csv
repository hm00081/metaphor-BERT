392,1,A dynamic diffusion series is used to highlight the key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process.
393,1,The collective responses to a given topic are summarized through the flow of retweets (represented as diffusion pathways).
394,1,"Original tweets or retweets that initiate significant amount of retweets can be observed through the density of tweets around the center, the density of diffusion pathways and the focused diffusion series, which help identify the opinion leaders in a multistep information flow."
395,1,"Temporal heterogeneity: The density and orientation of moving retweet glyphs capture whether a given topic is a short burst or a long lasting trend, and whether the burst or trend differs for different communities."
396,1,"To enhance visual pattern comparison, a visualization should encode key information into structurally organized component features which can be easily identified across multiple patterns."
397,1,"Role identification: When tracing information diffusion in social media, it is crucial to identify key roles such as opinion leaders. It has been recognized that opinion leaders play decisive roles in the spread of information."

408,1,OpinionSeer could also be applied to visually analyze customer opinions on other products or services.
409,1,"We design and develop OpinionSeer to address the need to effectively communicate opinion mining results and facilitate the analytical reasoning process. In the system, we use a new feature based opinion mining technique to faithfully model the uncertainty in the review text."
410,1,"Hospitality researchers can use it as a general analysis tool to analyze and detect hidden patterns in raw text data, and provide a user friendly visual presentation to end users such as hotel managers. For hotel managers, the system allows them to identify useful and meaningful relationships quickly among vast amounts of textual data uploaded by customers on the e channel, so that an effective decision can be better formulated to give timely and appropriate responses to the customers."
411,1,OpinionSeer could be applied to the visual analysis of customer opinions on other products or services
412,1,We combine an opinion mining technique with subjective logic to model uncertainty in opinions and fuse the opinions.
413,1,We design a new visual representation for customer feedback data to naturally encode the uncertainty information.

418,1,Are there any temporal patterns regarding the users opinions?
419,1,"The free text comments of reviews, on the other hand, are more informative (e.g., reasons for the opinions) than the ratings, providing concrete and descriptive information about customer opinions."
420,1,"To analyze customer opinions from different aspects, hotel managers and hospitality researchers usually need to classify customer reviews into different categories (or features) such as service, space, and cleanliness [1, 2, 19]. Thus, we use a feature based opinion mining method [12, 23] to extract opinions from the customer reviews. It works as follows."
421,1,"To assist users in visually analyzing the complex opinion data effectively,"
422,1,to help user examine the real reason of a certain opinion as well as to compare customer reviews.
423,1,"By observing the TextWheel and its content changes, some interesting patterns can be detected. We use our system to analyze several news corpora related to some major companies and the results demonstrate the high potential of our method."
424,1,"there may exist complex macro/micro relations between keywords and articles. At the micro level, keywords (e.g., Bill Gates and Microsoft) have various relations. At the macro level, text articles may be also related (e.g., dealing with the same topic). Meanwhile, each article contains multiple keywords and each keyword likely appears in many articles; these relations may change with time."

435,1,A visual summary of the video should preserve important contents based on viewers’ interests. It should contain sufficient information from both the video itself and the audience to support further pattern and climax analysis. 
436,1,"In other words, this requires the visualization to process danmu posts (texts) and video frames (images) collectively."
437,1,An effective video summary should reveal the main plot of the video so that users can grasp the storyline at a glance.
438,1,"This requires not only extracting proper representative frames from the video but also capturing the innate relationship among these frames, which can be a challenging task."
439,1,The visualization should highlight viewerspoints of interest and enable a quick climax detection.
440,1,"We examine here people centered visualizations for showing data about a person, illuminating relationships among people, and for representing individuals for on line interaction."

481,2,Multiple items appearing in these parts of the streams are shown on the bridge.
482,2,River Curve
483,2,Bars on the bridge
484,2,We base on a river and bridge metaphor in the visualisation design. The river metaphor is quite often adopted for representing data streams.
485,2,"In Co Bridges, each of the two river sides represents one data stream. We choose to show the river flow along the vertical display dimension; hence, the time or sequence is encoded by the vertical axis. The vertical layout allows several river instances to be juxtaposed in a display."

544,2,"The important reposting behaviors, the following relations and the semantics relations are represented as rivers, routes and bridges, respectively, in a virtual geographical space"
545,2,"key players are visualized as lakes, and users reposting them become counties. Counties with similar topics form a region, while a lake and its surrounding counties form a country, which represents a subtree of the reposting tree. Connected countries form continents, and isolated islands represent messages that are different from the continents in topics. We use multiple connection symbols to represent different relations between key players. A river connecting lakes represents the reposting relations between key players. A route represents a reposting message that was not made by a follower, and a bridge represents a reposting message causing different repostings in semantics"
546,2,"we introduce R Map, an interactive visualization with map symbols"

580,2,Personality Sectors
581,2,"The wheel metaphor, inspired by both classic Radial Space Filling (RSF) technique and the beauty of Goethe’s color wheel, has several benefits compared with a traditional bar chart: the wheel metaphor with radial sectors conveys a representative sense of a brand’s personality, and lower memory cost with the metaphor from real life; it is also aesthetically more appealing and engaging than a bar chart."
582,2,"In analogy to the Goethe’s color wheel, each personality sector represents one personality trait, and multiple sectors in an RSF layout illustrate a brand’s personality profile with a set of personality traits."
583,2,"To balance aesthetics and functionality, curved wheel sectors are used to achieve the visual appearance of Goethe’s color wheel."

647,3,"In density maps, red and green visually encode negative and positive opinions, respectively."
648,3,The size of a keyword visually encodes the keyword frequency in the topic. 
649,3,We can also observe some transition lines between different topic strips. Each line that connects two topic strips represents the amount of user attention that flows between the two corresponding topics.
650,3,The attention level of at user i to topic k at time t is the number of the tweets of the topic divided by the total number of all the tweets (posted by the user at time t). 
651,3,The height of the corresponding topic strip at time t is then determined by the aggregated attention of all the users (who post tweets about topic k at time t).
652,3,An edge with a higher priority will be more likely to have attention transition.
653,3,We sort the topic strips according to size. We then position the strip with the largest number of users.
654,3,"Some negative opinions (in red regions) could also be observed, which could be attributed to a variety of factors such as compatibility issues."
655,3,"offer a dynamic and appealing interface. Colours, shapes, and arrangements should be accessible, inviting, and visually pleasing."
656,3,we decided to order by general newness of a topic from top to bottom of the streams.
657,3,the y axis is used to encode relative frequency of topics by the vertical width of the stream corresponding to a topic at a particular time point.
658,3,"The mapping from newness to colour is done in the HSV (hue, saturation, value) colour space. We choose a subset of the hue spectrum between blue and green, with the newest topics represented by green and the oldest in blue. To make the streams of newer topics appear brighter and more saturated we map greater newness to higher saturation and higher value."
659,3,The stream shapes are defined by cubic Bezier curves
660,3,"While the vertical width of an individual stream at a specific time interval is determined by the relative number of topic occurrences in tweets during this time bin, the overall sum of the stream widths per time interval corresponds to the sum of occurrences of these most popular topics."
661,3,The font size of the label is correlated with the overall number of occurrences of the topic in this time window and its colour is a darker tone of the colour of the stream.
662,3,The opacity of a highlight depends on the relative frequency that a topic was mentioned.

678,3,"Each item block has two color regions, encoding the item frequencies in the corresponding stream."
679,3,"Thus, to enable assessment of frequency differences, 3 visual variables are used: position(order), color and size."
680,3,"The width of a bridge (in the 2D visualization, refers to the vertical length of a bridge) encodes the accumulated frequency of the items."
681,3,but each bridge has a different width proportional to the combined stream volumes.
682,3,"Quantitative comparison is supported by employing the sizes and positions of the item blocks, the heights of the curves, and the height of the bars on the bridges."
683,3,"Since location and orientation create the hub and spoke diagram this leaves visual variables such as colour, size, shape, (light and dark) value, and texture."

692,3,"The darker the color value of the message circle, the more characters that are typed for that message."
693,3,the sentiment information is quantitatively represented as the screen distance between a community strand and a sentiment pole.
694,3,"the sentiment information is also represented by a color gradient from green to red, pertaining to two sentiment poles."
695,3,The community size implies its influence and is encoded as the thickness of the strand.
696,3,"The sentiment pole ‘positive (in green)’ and ‘negative (in red)’ are preselected and placed at the top and the bottom side of the view, respectively."
697,3,Two communities are polarized between them as curving strands with gradient colors corresponding to their sentiments.
